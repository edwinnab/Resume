    <p>
        I am a highly skilled and passionate software engineer with extensive experience in both frontend and backend development. My expertise spans JavaScript, React, Angular, Python, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, and CSS, enabling me to build robust and visually appealing web applications. Proficient in frameworks like React.js and Angular, I excel in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces. 
        <br /><br />
        I have successfully integrated APIs into software solutions, enhancing functionality and ensuring seamless communication. My experience with databases, particularly MySQL, complements my solid understanding of backend development using Ruby on Rails and Python.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to my technical skills, I have honed my communication and teaching abilities through my role as an instructor in software engineering.
